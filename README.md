Pathfinding Visualizer:
This project is a simple pathfinding visualizer implemented in C++. It allows users to visualize the process of finding a path from a start point to an end point using either Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.

Features:
Grid-based visualization of pathfinding algorithms.
Option to choose between BFS and DFS algorithms.
Random obstacle generation.
Visual representation of the pathfinding process.

Installation:
To run the pathfinding visualizer, you'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Simply clone this repository and compile the main.cpp file using your preferred compiler.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinding-visualizer.git
cd pathfinding-visualizer
g++ main.cpp -o pathfinding

Usage:
After compiling the code, run the executable pathfinding. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the pathfinding algorithm and visualize the process.

Algorithm Selection:
When prompted, you can choose between the following algorithms:
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Depth-First Search (DFS)
